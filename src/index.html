			<a href="example1.html">In or out the viewport</a>
			<p>
				A very basic example of the IntersectionObserver. It will show a feedback message when a target element enters or exits the viewport.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="example2.html">How much is visible?</a>
			<p>
				Using the threshold option it is possible to specify at which ratios a notification should be given.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="example2a.html">How much is visible: oversized edition</a>
			<p>
				When the observed target is bigger than the root element, the IntersectionObserver will stop notifying when the intersection ratio stops changing.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="example2b.html">How much is visible: horizontal scroll edition</a>
			<p>
				The IntersectionObserver also works when used on a horizontal scroll page.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="example3.html">Modify the intersection area</a>
			<p>
				Using the rootMargin option it is possible to shrink/grow the area of the root element. This examples shrinks the root by 80 pixels.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="example4.html">Showing the active chapter</a>
			<p>
				Example that shows how to modify the root margin so elements that pass the middle of page get notified.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="example5.html">Extending the intersection area</a>
			<p>
				In this example the root is expanded so elements trigger a notification as they're about to enter the viewport. This can be used for instance to lazy load images as they're about to become visible.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="example6.html">Alternate root element</a>
			<p>
				The root option allows to specify a different element than the viewport to act as the root element.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="example7.html">Initialize modules JIT</a>
			<p>
				By extending the margin around the viewport and some JS it is possible to initialize JS functionality as the element is about to come into view.
